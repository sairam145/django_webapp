Deployment
To deploy this project to a web server, follow these general steps:

Set up a web server that can run Python applications. This could be a VPS, a PaaS like Heroku, or a cloud-based server like AWS.

Clone the repository to your server:

bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/ashish-makes/django-tailwind-blog.git
Install the project dependencies on your server using pip:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt
Set up a database for the project, if necessary. You can use a database like PostgreSQL, MySQL, or SQLite, depending on your needs.

Configure the settings.py file with your server's settings:

python
Copy
Edit
DATABASES = {
    'default': {
        'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.postgresql',
        'NAME': 'mydatabase',
        'USER': 'mydatabaseuser',
        'PASSWORD': 'mypassword',
        'HOST': 'localhost',
        'PORT': '5432',
    }
}

STATIC_ROOT = '/var/www/static/'
MEDIA_ROOT = '/var/www/media/'

ALLOWED_HOSTS = ['example.com', 'www.example.com']
The DATABASES setting specifies the database connection details. In this example, we're using PostgreSQL with a database named mydatabase, a user named mydatabaseuser, and a password of mypassword. The STATIC_ROOT and MEDIA_ROOT settings specify the file paths where static files and media files will be stored. The ALLOWED_HOSTS setting is a list of domain names that the application is allowed to serve.

Run the python manage.py collectstatic command to collect all the static files into the STATIC_ROOT directory:

bash
Copy
Edit
python manage.py collectstatic
Start the Django development server, or set up a production server using a WSGI server like uWSGI or Gunicorn:

bash
Copy
Edit
python manage.py runserver
Access the website using your server's IP address or domain name, and the port number of the server if necessary. For example, if you're running the development server on port 8000, you can access the website at http://your-server-ip:8000/.

Conclusion
This project provides a simple and clean implementation of a developer portfolio and blog, with full responsiveness and powerful admin features. It is easy to deploy and can be customized to suit the needs of any developer looking to showcase their work and connect with others.
